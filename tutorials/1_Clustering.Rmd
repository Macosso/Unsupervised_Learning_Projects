# 1. Similarities and differences of k-means, PAM and CLARA

K-means, PAM (Partitioning Around Medoids), and CLARA (Clustering Large Applications) are popular unsupervised learning algorithms used for clustering analysis. Despite the similarities between these methods, they do also have some dissimilarities. In this article present similarities and differences between these methods focusing on approach to clustering, computational cost, and appropriate use cases.

## 1.1.	Similarities and differences
All the three algorithms are unsupervised learning algorithms that do not require target variable in the dataset, In addition to that, they are all partitional clustering algorithms, which means that they assign each data point to a single cluster. Furthermore, they are all iterative algorithms that aim to minimize a defined objective function that measures the similarity between data points in a cluster and the dissimilarity between different clusters.
Similarities and differences


### 1.1.1.	Construction of clusters
In K-means each cluster is represented by its centroid (mean) of the data points assigned to it. The algorithm assigns each data point to the closest centroid and updates the centroids until there is convergence. 
On the other hand, with PAM each cluster is represented by a medoid, which is the most centrally located data point in a cluster. At the initial stage the algorithm assigns random data points as medoids, and then iteratively swaps a medoid with a non-medoid point to improve the clustering.
To reduce the computational cost of PAM, the data can be split into multiple samples and run PAM on each sample, which is known as CLARA algorithm which the extension of PAM algorithm with less computational cost as it works on a sample of the data rather than the full dataset.


### 1.1.2.	 Use cases
K-means is more suitable for datasets with a moderate number of clusters and well-separated data points. PAM on the other hand is more appropriate for datasets with noisy or high-dimensional data and where the number of clusters is not obvious. However, when faced with large dataset that might not be feasible to run PAM algorithm on the entire dataset, CLARA algorithm should  be considered. 

### 1.1.3.	 Efficiency
K-means can easily converge quickly even on large datasets. However, the optimal convergence is not guaranteed. On the other Hand, PAM is slower than k-means due to the distance calculation, but it is more robust to outliers and can produce better results when faced with noisy data. Furthermore, CLARA, can be slower than PAM as it needs to generate multiple samples of the data, but it can handle large datasets and can produce more reliable results than k-means or PAM.

### 1.1.4.	Computational cost
K-means has the lowest computational cost when compared to PAM and CLARA. However, it can get stuck in local optima, which might not be the global optima. The algorithm scales linearly with the number of data points and the number of clusters. PAM on the other hand,  has a higher computational cost than k-means, because it computes distances for each data points and the medoids for each iteration. While CLARA has the highest computational cost between these three algorithms, because it requires running on multiple samples.

### 1.2.	Summary
To sum up, despite similarities between K-means, PAM, and CLARA, there are also significant differences between them, more specifically when it comes to how clusters are constructed, computational cost, efficiency, and appropriate use cases. K-means is fast and suitable for datasets with a moderate number of well-separated groups within the dataset, while PAM and CLARA are slower but more robust to datasets with a lot of noise. Furthermore, PAM is appropriate for noisy or high-dimensional datasets where the number of clusters is not known in advance, while CLARA is more suitable for large datasets where robust clustering results are desired.

# 3. Pre and post diagnostics in clustering 
Before clustering, it is important to perform some diagnostics to ensure that the data is appropriate for clustering and to select appropriate clustering parameters. After clustering, it is also important to perform post-diagnostics to evaluate the quality of the resulting clusters. Here are some examples of pre and post-diagnostics in partitioning and hierarchical clustering in R:


## 3.1. Pre-diagnostics:

### 3.1.1. Check for outliers
Outliers can have a significant impact on clustering results, so it is important to identify and remove them before clustering. One way to identify outliers is to plot the data using boxplots or scatterplots and look for data points that are far from the main cluster.

### 3.1.2. Check for normality
Many clustering algorithms assume that the data is normally distributed. To check for normality, you can use histograms, normal probability plots, or the Shapiro-Wilk test.

### 3.1.3. Choose the number of clusters
In partitioning clustering, it is important to choose the number of clusters before clustering. One way to do this is to use the elbow method, which involves plotting the within-cluster sum of squares (WSS) for different numbers of clusters and selecting the number of clusters where the decrease in WSS begins to level off.

## 3.2. Post-diagnostics:

### 3.2.1.Cluster validity indices
There are several indices that can be used to evaluate the quality of clustering results. Some popular indices include silhouette width, Dunn index, and Calinski-Harabasz index. These can be computed using functions such as ```silhouette()``` and ```clusvalid()```.

### 3.2.2. Visualizations
Visualizations can be helpful for evaluating the quality of clustering results. For example, dendrograms and heatmaps can be used to visualize hierarchical clustering results, and scatterplots can be used to visualize partitioning clustering results. R provides many functions for creating these visualizations, such as ```fviz_dend()``` and ```fviz_cluster()````.






# 4. Available distance measures overview â€“ similarities, differences, suggested applications Or How clustering works with colours and images

## 4.1. Distance measures and similiarity measures

Distance measures are used in clustering analysis to calculate the dissimilarity or similarity between observations. Here is an overview of some commonly used distance measures:

* ```Euclidean distance```: This is the most common distance measure in clustering analysis. It calculates the straight-line distance between two points in n-dimensional space. Euclidean distance is appropriate when the variables are continuous and have similar scales.
Euclidean distance between two points $(x1, y1)$ and $(x2, y2)$ in two-dimensional space:
$d = sqrt((x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2)$

* ```Manhattan distance```: This is also known as the "city block" distance. It calculates the distance between two points by adding up the absolute differences between their coordinates. Manhattan distance is appropriate when the variables are continuous and have different scales.
Manhattan distance between two points $(x1, y1)$ and $(x2, y2)$ in two-dimensional space:
$d = abs(x2-x1) + abs(y2-y1)$

* ```Cosine similarity```: This measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors in n-dimensional space. It is commonly used for text clustering or when the variables represent word frequencies.
Cosine similarity between two vectors A and B:
$cosine_similarity = \frac{(A.B)} {(||A|| * ||B||)}$

where A.B is the dot product of vectors A and B, and ||A|| and ||B|| are the magnitudes of vectors A and B, respectively.

* ```Pearson correlation```: This measures the linear relationship between two variables. It is commonly used when the variables are continuous and have different scales.

* ```Jaccard similarity```: This measures the similarity between two sets of binary variables. It is commonly used in market basket analysis to measure the similarity between customers' shopping baskets.



## 4.2. Clustering on colors and Images
Clustering can also be applied to colors and images. In color clustering, each pixel in an image is treated as an observation with three variables (red, green, and blue values). Distance measures such as Euclidean or Manhattan distance can be used to calculate the dissimilarity between pixels. The resulting clusters can then be used to identify different regions or objects in the image.

In image clustering, each image can be treated as an observation with many variables representing the pixel values. Distance measures such as Euclidean distance or correlation can be used to calculate the dissimilarity between images. The resulting clusters can then be used to identify similar images or to perform image segmentation.
